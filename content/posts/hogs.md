summary: "A historical, contemporary, and fictional perspective on America's feral hog problem."
draft: true
---

When the first Europeans came to the Americas, they brough hogs with them, intent on releasing them to the wild so they could later hunt them and eat them.  The hogs were self-sufficient enough to survive and thrive, providing the spanish with a source of meat without having to keep protected farm animals.

Since the days of the spanish, the hogs have thrived and spread across North America.  They eat anything and everything, they have lots of babies very quickly, they are smart and wily and can teach each-other how to avoid traps.

> After defining exactly how the Feral Hogs are a pest and nuisance, and using sources to show what they are capabale of, how much damage they can cause, move on to the sparrows.

### Exterminating the Chinese Sparrow

> Describe the consequences of hunting the chinese sparrow and compare-contrast with the feral hog situation

### Genetic Mosquito Control

> Contraception provides potential for a more humane approach to solving the problem than toxicants, use Mosquitoes as an example of an apparantly successful effort to use genetic contraception to control mosquito population, but also be sure to point out the differences between the Mosquitoes and the Hogs.  Describe the drawbacks of contraception and the ability of the contraception to affect not just hogs but also other mammal species.

### What Happened to the Krogans

> Introduce the game Mass Effect and its subplot about the Salarians genetically modifying the Krogans to reduce their fertility.  Feral Hogs are smart: using genetic means of population control could be comperable to what happened to the Krogans.  Compare to other methods of population control such as using toxicants (poison).
