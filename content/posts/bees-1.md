I think too much about gender.  Perhaps that's inevitable; as a trans person, gender has impacted my life _a lot_.  Navigating my transition taught me a lot about gender.  And as the trans community has grown up alongside me, we have reflected together about what our experiences say about society, gender itself and the realtionship between the two.

Recently I've been reflecting on the way the models we use to understand gender have changed.  As non-binary identities have become more prominent, we moved away from the gender binary and towards the gender spectrum.  Even beyond the gender spectrum I've seen a "gender triangle," with the three poles being `masculine`, `feminine`, and `agender`.  Beyond even that, some people identify completely outside of the gender spectrum between masculine and feminine.

Thinking about all of these things, and reflecting on my personal experience as a binary trans woman, I can come to only one conclusion: **gender is just a fucking swarm of bees**.

See, I have a specialized computer science degree focused on the unholy grimoire of numerical methods: solving complicated mathematical equations with computer algorithms.  And learning to see the world in terms of statistics, algorithms, machine learning, and linear algebra has really shattered the way I think about making labels.  I started to see paralells between different algorithms I learned in school and the way we have evolved our thinking on gender, gender expression, gender identity, and even biological sex.

Let's go on a journey: let's explore how we think about gender by trying to create an algorithm for gender.  The goal here isn't to be right exactly, it's just to take the opportunity to think of gender from a different perspective.

Shall we begin?

### The Infinite Axes of Human Variability

Intuitively, I feel like gender is not real in the same way that certain other traits about us are real.  For example, you can be `176 cm` tall, but whether you are a `tall` or `short` person is a relative term that depends on having people to compare to, and perhaps a _lot_ of people to compare to.  I feel like gender exists in this sort of space: it describes some phenomenon that exists whether or not gender itself exists.  That is why different societies, cultures, and times have varying understandings of gender.

This is a convenint setup for us because we want to create an algorithm the way a computer would: by taking in some data, doing some math, and identifying a pattern as the output.  That pattern will be gender, or perhaps even biological sex.

When we think of people, what does that data look like?

Since we are trying to determine gender from the data, we will leave gender out of the dataset (for now).

A great place to start is to think about what we can measure.  Some obvious data points jump out such as height, weight, age.

### Next Time: The Gender Binary

In the next part we will `quantize` people by their traits into two (and more) groups.
